Pi number estimator that's using random points on Cartesian plane.
I was inspired to write this program after I watched one of Joma Tech vidoes on YouTube. I wanted to make that pi number estimator program and visualize it on an nice looking GUI
I love making nice looking designs so first I came up with this UI. I used Figma to create it.

## How does it work?
First we create random points on a Cartesian plane (like belowe)
Now we have to find out how many of points are inside that circle. Then we just need to devide number of points in circle by all the points we have created. Because we used just on quadrant - one section from Cartesian plane, the result we have to multpiply by 4. That's it, we just estimated Pi number.
